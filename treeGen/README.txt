This is a modified version of dgreenheck's tree generation tool (https://github.com/dgreenheck/ez-tree.git)
Credit for TreeGen goes to them.

I modified the generation code to be more streamlined. This involved a good deal of refactoring to eliminate dependencies.
The ornaments were a personal touch.
